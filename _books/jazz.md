review: >
  Jazz feels very all over the place, and I suppose it was written to be that way. To be like jazz- to be out of sync, unstructured, held together only be the sheer progression of music, or in this case, words. Before reading the book, I saw mentions of Toni Morrison’s ‘lyricism’. And I experienced it firsthand. Morrison has a way with words, with sentences, it almost feels like I am reading poetry which has been molded to fit into paragraphs and the conventional structure of a novel. It’s a joy (although very rarely a pain) to read and her ‘lyricism’ makes you keep wanting to read this somewhat straightforward novel in terms of the story. A plethora of metaphors and similes guide the sentences, and not once does it feel overdone or unnecessary.

  
  At one point, I was a bit frustrated, as it seemed nothing was going nowhere and it was a little hard to follow whose point of view I was reading. It did require patience to understand what Morrison was doing, revealing subtle bits of information here and there, enough to keep me hooked. I felt like I needed to be more informed about jazz music in general, as after I finished the book, I looked up more about the structure, or rather lack of, in jazz. The disorganization was clear from the beginning, but learning that every soloist has their say while also following the same progression made a lot more sense when analyzing the characters, as the book jumped between each of them and gave every one of them their fair share of screen, or rather page time. It helped me connect a lot more with the characters, and understand why they performed the actions they did. It felt like I was genuinely inside their heads, processing their every thought.

  
  The ending felt a bit rushed, and somehow not in tone with the rest of the book, a happy ending was just jammed into it. It was a good read and I think I should read it again in a few years time to appreciate it more.
