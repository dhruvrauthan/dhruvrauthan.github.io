  ** spoiler alert ** Man does not trust what he cannot see. Stormgren moves from a blindly trusting man to slowly becoming curious again- perhaps a sign of the basic human instinct returning. Ironically, it was a blind man who opened his eyes.
  
  Stormgren is a fantastic name. It holds a lot of gravitas. Perhaps that is why everyone called him Rikki- that made the surname less scary. He felt very personable, was funny and also level headed. Perhaps all qualities you’d expect from the UN secreterary general, but made for a likable character nonetheless.

  Still an interesting choice to make the Overlords look like the devil itself. I wonder why Clarke chose to do this?
  Coming back to this after finishing the book- I really liked Clarke’s explanation. As humans knew the end of their world was near, they indirectly associated the Overlords with causing it. And this image of the Overlords was passed through the sands of time, through the collective consciousness of humanity to the point where our ancestors had this ‘feeling’ that the devil, the one who brought forth the destruction of humanity itself was Satan/Karellen. It tied it very well with the entire stream of consciousness discussion in the last few chapters.

  It was also interesting how Clarke expected creative art to decline after Earth became a utopia. His basis was since there is no adversity faced by humans- there was no artistic expression. I initially felt the opposite. Since humans had so much free time on their hands, they could then focus their energy towards creative output rather than figuring out how to put food on the table. But I suppose his reasoning makes more sense than mine. True art, real art, is the expression of human pain and suffering. When you feel very strongly about something, art is the most natural human instinct. We have been expressing ourselves since cave men. Does utopia result in regression of the human emotion?

  It’s written like someone is describing a movie. Each scene is described just enough and the rest left to imagination. It is hard to strike the balance between overdescribing environments to the point that you become disconnected with the actual situation and just focusing on dialogue, a balance which Clarke manages well.

  The ending was beautifully overwhelming. Childhood’s end? I understand it now. Jan’s helplessness and simultaneous awe at the situation mirrored my own emotions. The way he described the end of our species and our planet made me feel not sad, but weirdly proud, that humanity had ascended to another form, far better than its current one. The children, instead of carrying with them their parent’s ideologies and traits, left all that behind, becoming their own organism completely. I suppose you can never control what your child will turn out to be.

  The book had some of the best characters and arcs I have ever read. Stormgren, George, Jean, Jan, Karellen, Rashaverak were extremely well fleshed out. No one overstayed their welcome. An excellent cast.

  Poignant. 5/5

  Quotes-
  “Evil men could be destroyed, but nothing could be done with good men who were deluded”
  “Suppose, in their altruistic passion for justice and order, they had determined to reform the world, but had not realized that they were destroying the soul of man?”
  “But in this modern world the greatest thing is to have an ideal. Achieving it is considerably less important”
