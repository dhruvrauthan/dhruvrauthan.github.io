review: >
  An interesting discourse about human consciousness and what it really means to be conscious. The story flows really really well and there is absolutely no time to take a breather. The technical discussions sometimes get a bit convoluted and hard to follow, especially since most of the time they don't seem to be making a lot of sense practically (but it is science fiction after all). I loved the 'horror' robox sequence towards the end, it was my favourite bit of storytelling in the book.
  
 
  Overall, a decently written book which gets a bit twisted at times and has a few sparks of fascinating discussion about the human condition.
