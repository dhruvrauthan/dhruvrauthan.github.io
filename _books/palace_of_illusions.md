  A fairly unique take on Panchaali’s point of view, and to some extent, her role in the Mahabharat saga. I have to say, it is an extremely well written book- the storytelling is captivating and it flows well. The dialogues between characters as a whole, feel very real and very conversational- it was witty and sarcastic and never missed a beat. It felt like I was listening to my grandfather narrate an amalgam of old stories when I was a kid- always knowing the outcome of each story did not stop me from eagerly wanting him to complete it. Reading this book felt the same, and having Panchaali’s point of view stopped the epic from getting repetitive and kept it fresh. It is a good take but did I like Panchaali’s character arc? Not particularly.

  
  I do appreciate the exploration of her and Karna’s love, but it feels like Divakaruni decided on this plot point in the beginning and couldn’t figure out how to advance it. There seems to be no progression in this cycle of 'he loves me-he loves me not'. It does get a bit irritating and frankly boring towards the end, and makes it really hard to root for Panchaali who does not seem to have any sort of character development at all. I understand that everyone had their flaws, especially in the Mahabharat, but come on there has to be something more than rotating the entire book around a single plotline. Kunti was a more intriguing and a much much well written persona instead.

  
  Reading the book felt a bit weird because of this, as it is so well written that you want to keep reading more but it becomes increasingly harder to root for the protagonist themselves. Overall, a good collection of individual stories but just a decent novel.
