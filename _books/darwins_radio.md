review: >
  The book has its ups and downs. The concept is amazing, and actually terrifyingly well written in terms of the government and public response. However, I felt like I was reading a different book in the final third. The pacing felt wildly off, and some of the decisions just didnâ€™t make sense considering the rest of the book. All in all, still a pretty decent book.
