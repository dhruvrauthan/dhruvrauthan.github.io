  Ah well, another classic dystopian book. To be honest, the ideas and concepts introduced at the start were somewhat scary but you couldn’t help but smile a melancholic smile, the one where you could relate and match it to the events happening in your generation. And I feel that is what makes this book so special, that no matter what age you are, you’d find yourself somewhat agreeing with Huxley about the state of the world and where it’s headed. That’s why it has held up so well even after all these years. The idea of industrializing the human body itself is terrifying and the book leads you down different trains of thought throughout.


  As for the characters, Bernard Marx wasn’t a perfect person and I suppose that is what makes him human. At his core, he is just like any of us, lonely when alone but desperate for validation from society. Cursing society till you get something from it. John Savage reminded me of Ted Kaczynski (eerily, who was born 10 years after this book was published), a person hating the evolution- or rather devolution- of society and wanting to be one with nature and the soul itself.
  Huxley’s writing style was really easy to follow, and his descriptions were apt. Not once did I feel disconnected reading the book. I especially liked the jumping of perspectives with each paragraph in some scenes, it felt like I was watching a movie in my head. All in all, a really solid book, one which makes you think deeply long after you’ve put it down.
