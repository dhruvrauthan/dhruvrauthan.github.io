  It has been a while since it was a pleasure to just *read* the book in a sense. It was just so so well written. Absolutely perfect. No sentence was too short, no description too long, no chapter a drag, no words written without purpose. After Kafka, I felt that perhaps these ‘classic’ titles weren’t for me. How wrong was I, and how happy am I to be proved wrong. Dostoevsky’s characters are fascinating, albeit a little hard to keep track of, his descriptions are succinct and above all his scenarios are laminar.


  The book gives us immense insight into the Siberian prison system at its peak. It reads like a collection of several disjointed short stories detailing different aspects of the prison life. It humanizes the convicts and their actions, and we find that they are really not that different from the rest of us. They live the same way we do, create similar relationships and bonds like us, find joy in the little things. You relate to them at some level. As for the characters, I wouldn’t say all of them are likable, rather all of them are human with their own strengths and flaws. And they are all extremely well written and feel engaging.


  Definitely one of my favourite classics. Oh and did I mention how well written it is?
