  ** spoiler alert ** The different genres of the book are well blended together. You have crime, horror, thriller and psychology (which are already close in terms of their nature) and the book readily flows between them. The pacing is incredible, it’s actually a very engrossing book and the chapters are perfectly long. The action sequences are engaging as well (especially Hannibal’s escape).

  The conversations between Clarice and Dr. Lecter are my favourite parts of the book. Two strong personalities trying to pry information from each other while also knowing very well what the other’s goal is. It’s entertaining watching them tiptoe around each other, stalking and prodding each other, testing each others’ limits, in very different senses.

  I also particularly like the dynamics between different characters. Crawford and Clarice the troubled mentor and the determined student, Clarice and Dr Lecter the patient and the therapist. The side characters such as Barney the orderly, Clarice’s roommate and the driver Jeff, have small but meaningful and rememberable moments. They are unexpectedly sentimental.

  The actual villain could have been a little more fleshed out (no pun intended). Hannibal takes over somewhat, which is expected due to his imposing character and personality. It seems like the book cannot decide its antagonist, or maybe it just does not want to.

  A good psychological thriller, perhaps not quite as bone chilling as you’d expect. A great read nonetheless which keeps you guessing throughout.

  “He knew that a middle-aged man can be so desperate for wisdom he may try to make some up, and how deadly that can be to a youngster who believes him”
