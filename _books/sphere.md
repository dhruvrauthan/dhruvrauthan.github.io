review: >
  The writing does it make you feel very claustrophobic, or perhaps it’s just the fact that imagining yourself a thousand feet deep underwater does the job itself- no matter how it is written. The book does trudge along for a while, after which it just decides to withhold information and blames it on some of the characters’ personality. I understand not revealing everything, but the way secrets were held made me irritated rather than curious.

  
  The psychology aspect of scifi stories is explored quite nicely. I like how the role of Norman, the psychologist, slowly comes into effect the longer the team spends their team underwater, cramped together. The human psyche breaks either instantly (like the seasick marine biologist) or unravels slowly, leaving signs here and there- a slight jab, a small argument, tiredness and general irritability. The different concepts of psychology, like the “three’s a crowd” and “repeating the last word to keep the other talking” are really interesting to read, also because they are not specifically applicable to just alien encounters, which the average human might not have everyday.


  The conversations flow extremely well. For such a variety of personalities, each dialogue is well representative of that person- making it easy to follow even when several people talk over each other (which is quite funny sometimes too, Crichton knows how to make conversations engaging).


  A page turner with an interesting discussion about the human psyche.
