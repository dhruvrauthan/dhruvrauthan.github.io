review: >
  Loved this book. The concept is absolutely amazing (although makes me think of the 3 body problem too). All the characters have extremely satisfying arcs and are extremely well written. An astronomer, a journalist, an archaeologist and a psychologist's point of views gave several unique perspectives towards the same problem which I liked. The pacing from the whole discovery and build up to actual nightfall is great, and it never felt like a bore. The post apocalyptic part was a bit out of tune with the rest of the book, I suppose this was the additional chapters after the short story adaptation. It did paint a grim but very realistic picture of post nightfall environments and behaviors, and felt very grounded. All in all, a fascinating concept and discussion of the human mind.
