  ** spoiler alert ** Man helps AI without knowing its intentions. AI wins.
  Top top scifi book about the manipulation of humans by AI and vice versa. Likable characters (who have their own flaws) and very well described environments. Not one scene felt unnecessary although the 'great reveal' took a fair amount of time.

  
  It does live up to the hype.
