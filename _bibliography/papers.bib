  abstract={Edge computing and storage have been proposed as an alternative to current cloud computing infrastructures to address the latter's limitations. However, edge computing services and support for applications based on edge infrastructures are still in the incipient stages. There are numerous storage services for efficient data storage in the cloud. In contrast, few such services exist at the edge. We look at the performance of a cloud storage service Cassandra when deployed on an edge network.
In this paper, we analyze Cassandra's performance in three different networks. We vary Cassandra's attributes and the overall conditions in each network to simulate a real-world scenario and study the effect on the total time taken for a particular request. We (a) establish trends for different configurations, (b) discuss the reasoning behind them, and (c) suggest optimal configurations for the networks used, which are important for deploying Cassandra in an edge setting.},

  abstract={Software defined wide area networks (SD-WANs) have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to provide efficient and secure communication across large geographical areas. However, the use of SD-WANs also presents potential security risks, including the possibility of developing covert channels between network hosts for malicious purposes. We analyse an open-source SD-WAN implementation, and investigate possible avenues for developing a covert timing channel in SD-WANs. We achieve this through surveying existing SD-WAN architectural literature and inspecting network traffic during simulations replicating specific network events. Our findings highlight the need for further research in this area to better understand the security implications of SD-WANs.},
